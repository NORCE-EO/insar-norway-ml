**🛠️ WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Overview

We study a graph-based semi-supervised approach that propagates sparse human annotations to unlabelled InSAR points, based on spatial proximity and temporal similarity.

### Problem Setup (draft)

- **Labels:** A small subset of points annotated as stable, gradually deforming, or rapidly deforming.
- **Graph:** Nodes correspond to InSAR points; edges connect spatial neighbours.
- **Objective:** Infer labels for unannotated nodes while maintaining smoothness across the graph and respecting confident seeds.
